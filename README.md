# Semantic Richness Comparison in Blind vs Sighted Participants

This repository contains the analysis and poster presented at [NAME OF CONFERENCE].

## 🧠 Objective

To estimate and compare the semantic richness of concepts generated by blind and sighted Italian participants using the Schao2BC estimator and coverage thresholds.

## 📚 Dataset Description

📚 Dataset Description

The present analysis is based on the BLIND dataset introduced by Lenci et al. (2013), which contains semantic feature norms elicited from congenitally blind individuals using a property listing task (PLT). This dataset was specifically developed to explore how the absence of visual experience affects conceptual representations.

In the PLT, participants were asked to freely generate features associated with a series of concrete and abstract concepts (e.g., “apple,” “justice”). These features include perceptual, functional, taxonomic, and encyclopedic information. This approach enables researchers to access the semantic content of concepts by analyzing the spontaneous linguistic production of associated features, which reflects the distributional richness and sensorimotor grounding of conceptual knowledge.

The current version of the dataset includes only the following variables:

Group (blind or sighted)

Concept

Coded feature response

Anonymous participant ID
